*"Mathematics is the simple bit, it's the stuff we can understand. It's cats that are complicated."* - John Horton Conway

## Life

In 1970, John Horton Conway devised the **Game of Life**. Life is a zero-player game; a simulation in which a set of initial conditions will be played out without the need for any human or sentient players. The game itself is infinite, set in a two-dimenstional grid of squares which we refer to as *cells*. Each cell is in one of two states: alive or dead. In each step of the game, each cell interacts with its neighbouring cells (in either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction). In each *tick* (or step) of the game, the new living state of a cell will be determined by the number of neighbours it has, giving us the *Rules for Life*

* A cell with one or no neighbours will die (as if by solitude or underpopulation)
* A cell with four or more neighbours will die (as if by overpopulation)
* A cell with two neighbours will survive (to be a part of the next generation)
* A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours will be brought to life (as if by reproduction)

### A Smart Contract Implementation

Whilst the implementation of Conway's game is rather simple in its algorithmic complexity, the difficulty of a smart contract implementation is in *storage*. The cost of storing the current the state of each step of the Game of Life on chain would be unreasonable, so we instead take advantage of _`view`_ functions to see the current state of the game (more specifcally, we will use _`pure`_ functions to view the current game state, as this function will not edit the contract state). 

We will set out to implement such an algorithm so as to enable the minting of an NFT which will begin with an initial seed state, and play out one tick of the Game of Life for each consecutive block since mint.

That gives us some requirements to start with: 

1. We want this to be sharable and ownable, so let's make it an ERC721 standard. We should be able to mint a Life token to a wallet.
2. Every token should be given a random initialisation
3. The Game of Life will start on the block in which the token was minted
4. Each consecutive block after mint will be one step in the game of life

Let's define an interface with the ability to mint a new Game of Life token and view its state. The state of the game (for a given token) will be viewed as arrays of bits which we can use to form a grid. For the sake of this implementation, we will use a 64x64 grid.

```solidity IGameOfLife.sol
interface IGameOfLife {
  function mint(address _receiver) external;
}
```

and we can extend the interface that we have created, as well as the ERC721 standard from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721)

```solidity GameOfLife.sol
contract GameOfLife is IGameOfLife, ERC721 {
  // ...
}
```

On-chain rondomizer -- we can just use pseudorandomise so feel free to game the contract to get exactly the outcome you want (good luck!)




See you in the next one.
