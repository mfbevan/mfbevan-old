> A brief summary of two talks I gave for [Labrys](https://labrys.io/) and [All Things Blockchain](https://www.allthingsblockchain.org.au/) events in June and August 2022, titled *Decentralised Society: Encoding Social Identity in Web3* 

## Social Identity and Trust

As we transition out of our comfortable web2 world and into the vast unknown of web3, the driving forces of the crypto community are still centred around transferable, financial assets. The economic value that we place on many of these assets are generated by people themselves, and the interactions and relationships we have with one another, yet there is no widely used standard for social identity or trust encoded on-chain which can be relied upon.

Instead, we usually rely on the social identity structures of web2 to fill the gap. You might try to verify the legitimacy of an NFT project by stalking the founders on Twitter. Sybil resistance is rudimentarily enforced by having someone verify that they aren't a bot by posting on Twitter or giving up identifiable information through KYC mechanisms. 

Whilst blockchain technology has been so focused on the idea of trustlessness, the current model can only get us so far. Without on-chain mechanisms of trust and credibility, we may never be able to migrate many key features of our economy into a decentralised web3 world. Not that trustlessness has been bad by any means: decentralised exchanges, trustless marketplaces and smart contract transactions supported by trustlessness have been and will continue to be key to the future of blockchain. 

***In code we trust.***

The inherent lack of a web3 social identity prevents many financial activities and contracts from ever being possible, including undercollateralized lending or rental agreements. Anyone who has attempted to sign their first apartment lease knows very well that being able to verify that you have enough money isn't quite enough. You will rely on the relationships, affiliations and credentials that you have built up over time to prove your credibility.

## Verifiable credentials

Before we dive into the world of DeSoc and Souls, we should first establish the concept of verifiable credentials: a standard for issuing, verifying and managing the credentials we rely upon. You can imagine these credentials as anything from driver's licenses to university degrees to passports. 

Let's stick with the university example for now. Instead of being issued a piece of paper for your years of blood, sweat and tears, you (the ***Holder***) are issued a digitally signed certificate by a university (the ***Issuer***) which can then be verified by someone wanting to know you have a legitimate degree (the ***Verifier***). The certificate is verifiable through cryptography, where we can assert the origin of a certificate as having been signed by a key linked to the issuer, and we would store these certificates in some form of registry.

W3C has also already set a standard for verifiable credentials with some interesting reading ***[here](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)***.

Hopefully, you can already see where we are going with this, and how blockchain can enable us to use verifiable credentials in a web3 world. Substitute Issuers and Holders for wallets, replace the centralised registry with a decentralised blockchain, mint certificates on chain as tokens, and we're on our way to decentralised verifiable credentials. 

## Decentralised Society (De-Soc)

Where does all of this come from, and where are we heading? In May of 2022, Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum), Puja Ohlhaver and Glen Weyl published an article under the title ***[Decentralised Society: Finding Web3’s Soul](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763).*** If you find this topic interesting, I would highly recommend reading the entire paper.

The paper is prefaced with the concept of Decentralised Society, DeSoc for short, defined as *"a co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods."*. The rest of this post will elaborate on some key ideas proposed in the article and how they might be used in our web3 world.

## Soulbound

We start with the concept of a ***Soul***. A Soul can be considered much like a wallet that we use in cryto today. It exists on-chain and contains ***Soulbound Tokens***, or ***SBTs***. This is a relatively recently popularised but not necessarily new concept. They are also referred to as non-transferrable tokens (NTTs) or account-bound tokens (ABTs) and represent commitments, credentials, accreditations and affiliations. One way to look at these public tokens is like a digital, on-chain, resume, where your degrees, credentials, achievements and employment history are tokens issued by external entities (much like we discussed above). These tokens are publicly visible, or private but zero-knowledge provable, they are non-transferable, and potentially revokable by an issuer.

### Public Soulbound Tokens

Public SBTs would be visible to anyone that looks at your Soul, the same way we can see any number of NFTs or fungible tokens that an Ethereum wallet holds by simply looking up that wallet's address. I imagine public Soulbound Tokens as being anything that you would be happy for other people to see on your CV or LinkedIn profile: degrees, job history, and achievements.

### Private, Zero-Knowledge Provable Tokens

Private tokens would not be visible, but would be zero-knowledge provable. This means that we can mathematically prove that a wallet contains a token without actually seeing the token that they own or its metadata. This is useful for tokens that may contain sensitive information, such as passports or licenses.

### Soulbound Verifiable Credentials

The simplest implementation of a Soulbound Token would be to have self-certified tokens that a Soul A has done activity B, represented as an SBT. We can obviously see how this can be abused, or rather not be useful at all. If I can issue myself a token saying that I completed a degree which I never actually did then is there really any value in that token? The real power of Soulbound Tokens comes into play when we can have another Soul C who was also a part of the activity who can attest to the validity of this claim, or more importantly be the one who issues the token altogether. An example of this might be that the Ethereum Foundation is a Soul that issues SBTs to Souls who attend a developer conference, or our university being a Soul who issues degree SBTs to other Souls who attend the university.

### Revocability

We can also introduce the concept of revocability. Perhaps universities can have the ability to revoke a degree in the instance of a misdemeanour or breach of conduct. This in itself introduces issues of decentralisation in which external entities have control over your tokens, but is perhaps necessary to enable social identity in a web3 world.

### Dark Souls

What happens if someone issues me a Soulbound Token that I don't want? Should I be able to revoke it? Perhaps, but perhaps not. There is value to both sides of this argument. In a situation where SBTs are not revokable, we can use them to place negative reputation on a Soul if they have done something bad or are contributing negatively to the networks and communities that they are associated with. This perhaps leads to the ability to very easily blacklist or 'cancel' a person by sending negative reputation SBTs to a Soul without the recipient being able to do anything about it. Whilst the value of negative reputation is extremely valuable, having total control over the tokens in your Soul is perhaps just as important. Ideally this will come down to implementation when we begin building robust standards for Soulbound Tokens.

## What is the Worth of a Soul?

How can we tell a good Soul from a bad one? Ideally, we would be able to look at the sum of a few or all Soulbound Tokens in a Soul and infer information from this to form a social identity. The activities you have participated in, certificates you have earned and connections you have made in the networks with which you associate all culminate in a new digital identity that is truly unique to your Soul. And from this social identity, we can perhaps derive a new level of credibility and trustworthiness that can be used to inform social contracts that were never before possible on-chain. We call this idea, ***Traversing a Soul***.

### Truth ≠ Provenance

> Just because it's on-chain, it doesn't make it true.

One interesting misconception about Soulbound Tokens, NFTs, and blockchain as a whole, is that it is a source of truth. When we consider something like the value of digital currency that a wallet holds, blockchain's digital ledger can be considered a source of truth, but really this truth is based on provenance - the origin. In the case of digital data, we can view provenance as the tracking of a piece of data, all of the owners that it has ever had, and all the changes ever made to it. This is the real power of Soulbound Tokens. Take our previous example: a Soul contains a token for a degree, and that degree token was issued by a university that has its own Soul, and that university Soul has its own tokens that represent the relationships and accreditations that the university has (perhaps with governments, educational boards and other educational institutions). We still have to trust that the piece of information issued by the university, and that trust can come from the tokens that the university itself holds. Provenance is key.

## The DAO of Souls

</div>


One of perhaps the most interesting applications of Soulbound Tokens that caught my attention is what is refered to as the ***DAO of Souls***, a decentralised autonomous organisation made up of Souls, instead of traditional wallets. Each member of the DAO, therefore, has its own value based on the quality of the tokens it contains. 

### Sybil resistance

DAOs are inherently vulnerable to what is known as a ***Sybil Attack***. In short, for a traditional DAO, if an entity can gain 51% of the voting power in the network, they actually have 100% of the power of the DAO (as no other entities can out-vote them). In one-token-one-vote DAOs this is extremely easy, you simply buy more tokens than anyone else and you are in control of the organisation. In a one-wallet-one-vote DAO, you spin up enough wallets and all vote for the proposal you wish to pass or fail and you again have control over the DAO. Now imagine a DAO in which voting power is conferred based on the value of a Soul. Bots can easily be distinguished based on their lack of SBTs, and more voting power can be given to those who have greater experience in the area of expertise concerning a proposal.

### Correlated Souls

Existing voting mechanisms are also extremely vulnerable to collusion, whether intentional or accidental. By analysing Souls for correlation (e.g attending the same events, similar background or experiences) we can determine certain groups that are likely to vote in the same way due to exposure to similar life experiences. If Souls that have extremely close connections with one another are all voting in the same way, it is possible that intentional collusion may be occurring, which can be countered by lowering the voting power of correlated souls. Obviously, there are ethical implications to this and the jury is still out on the best approach to vote-weighting in DAOs in general.

## Plural Network Goods

The goodest good. The most good good. The best good for all. Good.

The idea of a plural network good is something that is good for all demographics in a population. A proposal that is a plural network good would be voted for by people from all manner of ethnic, religious, financial or educational backgrounds. This concept is as opposed to the most highly voted good which was actually just voted on by the people with the most money (as in our one-token-one-vote DAO above). Plurality wins in my books. An implementation of Souls and Soulbound Tokens in something like a DAO of Souls can enable these plural network goods to be built to shape the world into a generally better place, that's better for all, not just those who can amass the most voting power.

## What Next?

> *"A co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods.”*

As we jump back to our original definition of Decentralised Society, hopefully, this article has enlightened you on how we might start to get there. As we continue to build on top of DeFi's concept of trustlessness, we will leverage DeSoc's idea of trust and social identity. Every person, or rather every Soul, can start to stake meaningful reputation in their web3 communities by accruing Soulbound Tokens to grow their networks in a positive way so as to contribute to plural network goods.

Technologies like Soulbound Tokens and the various forms of on-chain digital identity that are yet to even be thought up are key to building a truly decentralised world. We have only just started on this journey into the world of digital identity, and there is still plenty more to be discovered. Here, there is a unique opportunity to start building new standards for verifiable credentials and be a part of the future of our industry. Start building!

See you in the next one.
