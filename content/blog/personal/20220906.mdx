#### Why you need a walletOf function

Many who have tried to implement ERC721 standard contracts and their various extensions will sooner or later come across the same problem. How do I view all of the tokens that a wallet holds? 

One such solution to this problem is to implement a _`walletOf`_ function at the contract level as a view function to return all of the tokens a wallet contains.

```solidity NFT.sol
function walletOf(address _walletOwner)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256[] memory result)
    {
        uint256 tokenCount = balanceOf(_walletOwner);
        if (tokenCount == 0) {
            return new uint256[](0);
        } else {
            result = new uint256[](tokenCount);
            uint256 index = 0;

            for (uint256 tokenId = 1; tokenId <= _totalMinted(); tokenId++) {
                if (index == tokenCount) break;
                if (ownerOf(tokenId) == _walletOwner) {
                    result[index] = tokenId;
                    index++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
