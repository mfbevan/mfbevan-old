#### A bit about me

My name is Matthew. I am a Software Engineer with a passion for programming and problem solving. After high school I was straight into university, and started studying a Bachelor of Mechatronics Engineering and a Bachelor Computer Science at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. After three years out of five, I landed my first job in the industry, kickstarted my professional career as a Full Stack Developer working on enterprise email suppression list management software, and quickly found a home working full time and building in the Web 2.0 space.

After a while, two main things occurred to me: 

1. I was having much for fun working as a developer full time than studying at university (let alone doing both), and
2. There was this weird itch that I couldn't seem to scratch: I was seemingly frustrated with the inherent centralisation and lack of individual ownership across an internet owned by the Big Five.


This next part probably won't suprise you: goodbye university. I finished up my fourth year at university and graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science, and started to work on honing my skills in personal time. I was still working as a developer full time, and had been putting some money into crypto here and there, not fully aware of what I was investing in. After all, it was just digital money, right? 

I was very wrong, I just didn't know it yet.

I stumbled blindy into the world of blockchain. I bought some shitcoins. I sold some jpegs. I found out about these smart contracts running on some network called Ethereum and started playing with those. This was what I was looking for: code running on a decentralised network being maintained by miners from all around the world, free (for now) from the clutches of the meddling Big Five. This was where I wanted to be. But, for a while, it was just something cool that I had dabbled with in my spare time.

In early 2022, by chance, I received a call that led to an interview with the team at [Labrys](https://labrys.io/), a blockchain development agency looking to **Shape the New World** and build cool shit in Web 3.0. I started working there a month later, I got my ENS **mfbevan.eth** shortly after that, and I was well on my way to building web applications and smart contracts alongside some of the best developers in the crypto space today.

Hopefully along the way I'll pick up a few things, and I'll share them here with everyone in a blog post format. Some posts will be technical, others will perhaps be meaningless rants. Enjoy them all nonetheless. If you're looking to reach out, or stalk me on Twitter, look no further than [@mfbevan.eth](https://twitter.com/mfbevan).

See you in the next one.
