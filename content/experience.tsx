The portal that we developed allowed students to sign up to the competition, for teachers to manager their teams, and for the competition staff to manage student and team data, including generating reports for accomodation, team submissions, and contact information. We also developed a submissions portal using AWS S3 where competition staff could create a new deliverable, to which individual students or teams could make submissions such as sign-up forms, and their final reports for the competition. The technologies I was exposed to in this project included a React Frontend, MariaDB database and AWS SAM Serverless API written in Python, where we used AWS Lambda to create a scalable serverless infrastructure that was low cost for the ASDC.",
