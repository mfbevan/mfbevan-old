### About me

I am a software developer with a passion for programming and problem solving. After completing a Bachelor of Computer Science, I jumped at the chance to kickstart my professional career as a Full Stack Developer working on enterprise email suppression list management software, and quickly found a home building in the Web 2.0 space. Frustrated with the inherent centralisation and lack of individual ownership across an internet owned by the Big Five, the concept of blockchain technology piqued my interest in 2021. Blockchain and the crypto space opens a world of opportunity for decentralisation, self-sovereign ownership and scaling like never before that I am passionate to be a part of since joining Labrys in 2022. At Labrys I work as a Full Stack Software Developer, tackling problems in both the Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 world, building web applications and smart contracts alongside some of the best developers in the crypto space today.
